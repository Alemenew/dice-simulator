# dice-simulator
this is dice simulator by using python programming language.

As we know dice are 6 faces when we are rolling they can generate one face to the top so I want to¸make this in python.
First I have to generate random integers number ranging between 1 to 6 to do this I have to import random package and declare a variable number after that I will assign some value on this variable and It’s range.
After this I am using if statement to decision making if the number is equal to 1 print some square it will contain only one hole this things are reputable up to 6.
And I am using while loop to iterate the program when once running this program it will continue if the user is pressing y key but it will stop if the user is pressing other key.

i am trying to learn if i made a mistake please tell me.
